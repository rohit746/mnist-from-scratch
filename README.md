# MNIST From Scratch

A neural network implementation built from scratch to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Overview

This project implements a neural network without using high-level machine learning frameworks, providing insight into the fundamental mechanics of deep learning.

## Requirements

```bash
uv pip install numpy matplotlib jupyter
```

## Usage

```bash
jupyter lab
```

This will open a local server in your default browser

## Dataset

The [MNIST database](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer) contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits (0-9).
